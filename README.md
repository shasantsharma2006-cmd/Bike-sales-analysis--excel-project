The Bike Sales Excel Dashboard Project is all about turning raw data into a story that’s easy to understand and explore. Using the Bike Buyers dataset from Kaggle, which has details of 1,000 customers, the project starts with cleaning up the data—removing duplicates and making sure details like gender and marital status are consistent. A separate working sheet is created so the original data stays untouched. From there, pivot tables are used to find patterns in things like average income, commute distance, and age groups. These insights are then brought to life with charts and combined into a single, interactive dashboard. Users can filter and explore the data to see, for example, how income differs between men and women, how commute distance affects bike purchases, or which age group buys the most bikes. It’s a clean, visually appealing tool that makes data analysis simple, engaging, and meaningful.
